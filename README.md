# TAD (v1.0)
## About
TAD (Todo App Demo) is a simple full stack task manager web app made with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/). This project aims to showcase my fullstack web development skills. This project is open source, but you should modify it first before deploying it, so as to not deploy an exact copy of this project, without my consent. 
## Nuxt Modules Used
[Nuxt Modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) supercharges your Nuxt projects to make your DX even more blissful. The following modules have being used extensively in this project:
- Nuxt Image 
- Nuxt Icon
- Nuxt Fonts
- Supabase
- Vueuse
- Pinia

 *Althouht Reka UI module is present in nuxt.config.ts, I didn't use it, in favor of Daisy UI.*
